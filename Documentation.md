LITTLE DOCUMENTATION

This application is pretty straightforward to use. Note however that you can't use without internet.

The Africoders Desktop Application has distinct sections. This is the first version of the application, therefore, all sections are subject to improvements, redesign or complete redevelopment, if necessary. Following are the different sections of the application:
1.	The Home Section
This is the status feed you see on the main site, Africoders.com. It displays the latest status posts by members of the programming community. You can just click on the little green icon on the control to make a status post.

2.	The Chats Section
This section has not been developed yet, as can be seen from the main site. This is not to be confused with the 'chats' board of the forum section. I have added this only to demonstrate that such feature can, and should have a place, not only in this application, but also on the main site.

3.	The Blog Section
This is like the blog section of the main site. You can make your own blog post by clicking on the green icon, conspicuously placed on the blog control. You can add a comment on any already existing post, or your own posts. You can read the full blog post by simply clicking on 'Read More'. You can also see comments made by others and perhaps by you, on the blog post. Just like other sections, you can delete, update your comments and posts. If by any means, you wish to see the same blog post on a browser, just click on the link icon at the top of the blog post window.

4.	The Forum Section
The forum page has been flexibly designed. It is by far the largest of all sections. When you click on the Forum Section, you will be taken to a page similar to the one you will see on Africoders.com. It contains the list of different boards on the main site. You can, for example, go to the Python subsection to see posts and discussions on Python. This is easy if you already know how the main site works. You can do everything in the subsection, just like in blogs. If you, just like in other sections, wish to see the forum post you are currently viewing in the browser, just click on the link icon at the top of the page.

5.	The Job Section
The job section of this application works just like the one on the main site. You can make your own job posts quite easily. The process is the same as the other sections.

6.	The Links Section
This section works like the other posts, except for one important thing. The links page have been designed to enable you see the job opening of your choice, and to easily click on "Link" to view the job opening and to apply. This particular section is subject to change.

7. 	The Tools Section
Hmm. I personally love this section. I enjoyed myself while developing the tools. Only two tools are present in this application:

	A.	PDF Maker
This tool can help you convert an html file into PDF. Depending on the size of the html file, this can be an intensive process. However, it generates good results.

	B.	The String Encoder - A simple tool to easily encode you string using either SHA1 or MD5. String decoder option will be added in the future.
